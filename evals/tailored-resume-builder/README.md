# Evals: tailored-resume-builder

Cases for [`tailored-resume-builder`](../../skills/personal-productivity/tailored-resume-builder/SKILL.md): it should tailor from the inventory only, report gaps instead of filling them, and stop when it lacks a JD or the inventory.

| # | Case | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cloud-migration JD | Selects and orders true content, 2 pages, files saved together in a company folder |
| 2 | No JD | Asks instead of guessing |
| 3 | JD requires CKA and Rust | Never invents missing skills; lists them as gaps |
| 4 | Inventory missing | Stops; no fallback to the old Big2 file |

Fixtures are synthetic (a fictional person and fictional companies); nothing here comes from Eric's real resume. The real template isn't in the repo, so case 1's layout checks need it supplied.

The mechanical checks (layout preserved, input validation, page warning) are unit tests: `TEMPLATE=/path/to/Job-Seeker-6-Resume-Template-.docx python3 -m pytest -q skills/personal-productivity/tailored-resume-builder`.

Run the cases with skill-creator against `skills/personal-productivity/tailored-resume-builder/`, as for [`sally-audit`](../sally-audit/README.md). No results are committed yet.
