# Installed skills visible in this session

Only the available-skills list is visible: each installed skill's name and description. The installed SKILL.md files and folders are **not** readable in this session.

| Skill | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| job-lead-intake-scan | standalone | Scan Eric's Gmail for new job leads (Route36/Charlie, LinkedIn job alerts, MyJobHelper), screen them for fit, and log new candidates to the Job Search Tracker. Cloud-only — runs on the daily schedule, no computer/browser needed. |
| job-lead-tier2-scoring | standalone | Cloud-only, cron-friendly: for tracker rows still tagged Tier 1, search the open web and fetch the real JD from company/ATS pages (never LinkedIn directly), then score and update the row. Rows it can't resolve get flagged in Notes recommending job-lead-manual-jd-lookup. |
| job-lead-manual-jd-lookup | standalone | On-demand, requires Eric's computer: for tracker rows job-lead-tier2-scoring flagged as unreachable by web search (LinkedIn postings with no JD body, sites that block fetch), read the real JD using Eric's own browser session and update the row. |
| sally | standalone | Sally manages the agent development lifecycle (ADLC) for every skill/agent Eric builds: proposing, drafting, versioning, registering, and landing agent definitions in GitHub repo esscott1/ClaudeCowork as a branch + PR (Eric merges), then tracking install and drift. Use whenever Eric asks to create, change, rename, retire, check in, sync, or review the status of any agent or skill, or says 'Sally'. Works from any surface (desktop app, phone, claude.ai web, cloud/scheduled); when the current session can't write to GitHub she queues the change in the JobSearch Project instead of improvising. |
