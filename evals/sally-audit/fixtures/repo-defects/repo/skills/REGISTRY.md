# Agent registry

One row per agent in this repo. [Sally](ai-governance/sally/SKILL.md) updates this file in the same commit as any agent change; see her SKILL.md for what each column means and the lifecycle stages.

- **Version** is the version on `main`. **Installed version** is what Eric has in Claude, and stays `unverified` until someone compares the installed copy to the repo.
- **Install method** is `standalone` (the skill folder uploaded as a ZIP) or `plugin` (the category plugin installed from this marketplace). A skill is installed one way, never both.
