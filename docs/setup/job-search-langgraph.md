# Setup guide: job-search pipeline (LangGraph approach)

This guide takes you from a fresh clone to evaluating a real job posting with your own resume. Budget about 45 minutes, most of it the one-time Google Cloud setup in step 3.

| Step | What | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Install tools and run the demo | Everything (no keys needed) |
| 2 | Add an Anthropic API key | Scoring and tailoring |
| 3 | Google Cloud OAuth app | Gmail intake (M2), Drive tracker import (M2) |
| 4 | Your master resume | Scoring and tailoring |
| 5 | Evaluate your first job | — |
| 6 | Optional: tracing and Studio | Debugging, portfolio screenshots |

Steps 1, 2, 4 and 5 are enough to use the evaluate graph today. Step 3 can wait until you start on intake, but do it early if you can: it's the step most likely to need a second attempt.

## 1. Install tools and run the demo

Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, git, and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esscott1/ClaudeCowork.git
cd ClaudeCowork/orchestration/job-search
uv sync --all-packages          # creates .venv with core + the langgraph approach
uv run pytest -q                # all tests use fakes — no keys, no network
uv run jobs demo                # walks the three graph paths with fake data
```

The demo shows a strong fit pausing for your review, a weak fit stopping below threshold, and a LinkedIn posting pausing for a manual job description. If that runs, your install is good.

## 2. Add an Anthropic API key

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Create a key in the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and paste it into `.env` as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. `JOBS_MODEL` pins the model so eval results stay comparable over time. Change it deliberately, then re-run the evals (step 6).

`.env` is gitignored. Never commit it.

## 3. Google Cloud OAuth app (Gmail and Drive, read-only)

The pipeline signs in to Google as you, with **read-only** scopes (`gmail.readonly`, `drive.readonly`). It can't send mail or change files.

### 3a. Create a project and enable the APIs

1. Open the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a project (for example, `job-search-pipeline`).
2. In **APIs & Services → Library**, enable the **Gmail API** and the **Google Drive API**.

### 3b. Configure the consent screen

In **Google Auth Platform** (older consoles call it **OAuth consent screen**):

1. **Branding:** app name `job-search-pipeline`, your email as support and developer contact.
2. **Audience:** user type **External** (required for a personal @gmail.com account).
3. **Data access:** add the scopes `.../auth/gmail.readonly` and `.../auth/drive.readonly`.

### 3c. Publish the app — don't skip this

> **This is the step that prevents weekly failures.** While an External app's publishing status is **Testing**, Google issues refresh tokens that [expire after 7 days](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration). The pipeline would then fail with authentication errors about once a week.

In **Audience**, click **Publish app** to move the status to **In production**. You do **not** need Google's verification for this. Google's verification rules [exempt apps used only by you](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/restricted-scope-verification) or a few people you know. The cost is a "Google hasn't verified this app" warning when you sign in. Click **Advanced → Go to job-search-pipeline (unsafe)**. That's expected for a personal app.

### 3d. Create the OAuth client

1. **Clients → Create client**, application type **Desktop app**.
2. Download the JSON and save it as `orchestration/job-search/data/google/credentials.json`.

### 3e. Sign in once

```bash
uv run jobs auth google
```

A browser window opens. Sign in, accept the warning from 3c, and grant both read-only permissions. The command saves a refresh token to `data/google/token.json` and verifies it with one read call each to Gmail and Drive:

```
Signed in. Gmail: you@gmail.com  Drive: you@gmail.com
```

From then on the pipeline refreshes access silently. **`token.json` is a credential.** It's gitignored and created with owner-only permissions. You can revoke it anytime at [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

## 4. Your master resume

Scoring and tailoring read your master resume as Markdown from `data/master_resume.md`. It's gitignored, so it never reaches the public repo. To convert your existing `.docx` with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html):

```bash
pandoc path/to/your_master_resume.docx -t gfm -o data/master_resume.md
```

Skim the result: tables and text boxes sometimes convert awkwardly, and the model can only score what it can read. When you later edit the master resume, the refresh graph (roadmap M5) detects the change by content hash and re-tailors unsubmitted resumes.

## 5. Evaluate your first job

```bash
uv run jobs add --company "Acme" --title "AI Enablement Architect" \
    --url "https://boards.greenhouse.io/acme/jobs/123"
# → LG-0001
uv run jobs evaluate LG-0001
```

Depending on the posting, one of three things happens:

| Outcome | What you see | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| JD fetched, score ≥ 7 | `resume_drafted`, waiting on `resume_review` | Read `data/resumes/LG-0001.md`, then `uv run jobs review LG-0001 --approve` (or `--reject --note "..."`) |
| JD fetched, score < 7 | `below_threshold` with the three gaps | Nothing. It stays logged with its score. |
| JD not reachable (LinkedIn, blocked ATS) | `needs_manual_jd` | Copy the JD into a text file, then `uv run jobs provide-jd LG-0001 --file jd.txt` |

Other commands:

```bash
uv run jobs list                          # everything, with status and score
uv run jobs list --status resume_ready
uv run jobs show LG-0001                  # details, status history, what it's waiting on
uv run jobs submit LG-0001                # you applied: records it as your action
uv run jobs set-status LG-0001 interviewing --note "Recruiter screen 10/8"
```

The status lifecycle is enforced. For example, a `below_threshold` job can't be marked `submitted`, and a submitted job can't be re-scored. Every change is recorded with who made it (`pipeline` or `user`), and later `email` when the status sweep lands.

To reuse IDs from your existing Excel tracker during shadow mode, pass `--id JS-042` to `jobs add`.

## 6. Optional: tracing, Studio, and evals

**LangSmith tracing.** Uncomment the `LANGSMITH_*` lines in `.env` and add a key from [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com). Note that the LLM calls go through the Anthropic SDK directly (core doesn't depend on LangChain), so you'll see graph and node spans. Per-call LLM traces are a roadmap item.

**LangGraph Studio.** This gives a visual graph, step-through, and state inspection:

```bash
cd approaches/langgraph
uv run --with "langgraph-cli[inmem]" langgraph dev
```

**Evals.** These check that the scoring prompt and model still land in expected bands against a synthetic candidate:

```bash
uv run python evals/job-fit/run_evals.py           # real model; writes results/latest.json
uv run python evals/job-fit/run_evals.py --fake    # harness only
```

To run evals in GitHub Actions on pull requests that change prompts, add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a repository secret (**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Google refresh token was rejected` about once a week | OAuth app still in **Testing** | Step 3c, then `jobs auth google` once more |
| `invalid_grant` right after setup | Signed in with a different Google account than the one you meant | Revoke at myaccount.google.com/permissions, rerun `jobs auth google` |
| `Access blocked: app has not completed verification` with no Advanced link | Scopes changed after publishing, or a Workspace admin policy | Re-check 3b; for Workspace accounts ask the admin to trust the client |
| `Master resume not found` | Step 4 not done, or `JOBS_MASTER_RESUME` points elsewhere | Check `.env` |
| `needs_manual_jd` for a site that works in your browser | Site blocks non-browser requests | Paste the JD with `provide-jd`; the job continues from where it paused |
| `This job is paused waiting on you` | You ran `evaluate` on a paused job | Answer the pending step, or `jobs evaluate ID --restart` |
